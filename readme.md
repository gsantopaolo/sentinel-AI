# sentinel-AI

An **event-driven**, **microservice** platform for real-time feed ingestion, filtering, ranking, and anomaly detection‚Äîdesigned to run on Kubernetes and scale to millions of users. üöÄüê≥

**Key Features:**

* üîó **Dynamic Ingestion:** Subscribe to any data feed (RSS, APIs, webhooks, etc.) and ingest events in real time.
* üßπ **Smart Filtering:** Apply custom relevance rules or plug in ML models to filter events.
* ‚öñÔ∏è **Deterministic Ranking:** Balance importance & recency with a configurable scoring algorithm; support on-the-fly reordering via APIs.
* üîç **Searchable Storage:** Persist full event metadata, embeddings, and scores in a vector database for fast semantic search.
* üö® **Anomaly Detection:** Automatically detect and flag unusual or malformed events.
* üìà **High Scalability:** Built on NATS JetStream and Kubernetes auto-scaling to serve millions of users with minimal latency.
* üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive Dashboard:** List, filter, rerank, delete events and sources, and visualize feeds in real time through a web UI.

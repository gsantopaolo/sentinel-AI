# sentinel-AI
Wen I read the specs for this project, and one of the requirements was to make the application to work at scale 
i suddenly told myself, to make it work at scale agents needs to become microservice able to work asynchronously whit an orchestrator logic, 
spread over various microservices driven by a message bus to deliver asynchronous operations requests.
In this scenario each agent has become a microservice with its own responsibility driven by an orchestrator, the scheduler.
You can see the full list of microservice and their own responsibility on the [**service matrix**](docs/architecture.md#service-matrix):

<br />
Sentinel-AI is an **event-driven**, **microservice** platform for real-time feed ingestion, filtering, ranking, 
and anomaly detection‚Äîdesigned to run on Kubernetes and scale to millions of users. üöÄüê≥



**Key Features:**

* üîó [**Dynamic Ingestion](docs/api.md):** Subscribe to any data feed (RSS, APIs, webhooks, etc.) and ingest events in real time.
* üßπ [**Smart Filtering](docs/filter.md):** Apply custom relevance rules or plug in ML models to filter events.
* ‚öñÔ∏è [**Deterministic Ranking](docs/ranker.md):** Balance importance & recency with a configurable scoring algorithm; support on-the-fly reordering via APIs.
* üîç [**Searchable Storage](docs/inspector.md):** Persist full event metadata, embeddings, and scores in a vector database for fast semantic search.
* üö® [**Anomaly Detection**](docs/inspector.md): Automatically detect and flag unusual or malformed events.
* üìà [**High Scalability](docs/architecture.md):** Built on NATS JetStream and Kubernetes auto-scaling to serve millions of users with minimal latency.
* üñ•Ô∏è [**Interactive Dashboard:](docs/web.md)** List, filter, rerank, delete events and sources, and visualize feeds in real time through a web UI.
